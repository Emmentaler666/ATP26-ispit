## User experience design

User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD), upon which is the centralized requirements for "User Experience Design Research" (also known as UX Design Research), defines the experience a user would go through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products.[1]  
User experience design is a user centered design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or platform.[2]  
Research, data analysis, and test results drive design decisions in UX design rather than aesthetic preferences and opinions, for which is known as UX Design Research.

Unlike user interface design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer interface, UX design encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product or website, such as its usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance. UX design is also an element of the customer experience (CX), and encompasses all design aspects and design stages that are around a customer's experience.[3]

## History

User experience design is a conceptual design discipline rooted in human factors and ergonomics. This field since the late 1940s has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and contextual environments to design systems that address the user's experience.[4]

User experience became a positive insight for designers in the early 1990s with the proliferation of workplace computers.[citation needed] Don Norman, a professor and researcher in design, usability, and cognitive science, coined the term "user experience", and brought it to a wider audience that is inside our modernized society.[5]

> I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow.  
> I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual.  
> Since then the term has spread widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.

## Elements of user experience

### Research

User experience design draws from design approaches like human-computer interaction and user-centered design, and includes elements from similar disciplines like interaction design, visual design, information architecture, user research, and others.

Another portion of the research is understanding the end-user and the purpose of the application.

### Visual design

Visual design represents the aesthetics or look and feel of the front end of any user interface.

### Information architecture

Information architecture is the art and science of structuring and organizing the information in products and services to support usability and findability.[8]

### Interaction design

Interaction design centers on the interaction between users and products.[11]

---

### Usability

Usability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals.[16]

### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures systems are usable by people with disabilities and aligns with WCAG principles.
